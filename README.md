# Shopicruit Task
This program was designed as part of Shopify's recruiting task. Given a JSON file, the task was to determine how much the maximum clocks and watches would cost you.

The main computation was written in JavaScript in conjunction with jQuery so that the information is displayed on an HTML webpage.
